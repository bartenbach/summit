# summit
summit is a (prototype) command line checksum validator.

Ever try and validate checksums before by just looking at them?  Yeah...that seems foolproof.  Well, now you don't have to anymore.

`summit -t md5 -f ./archlinux.iso -e d0ae8c4b4a037238e5f0880243d4619e`

## NOTE
This is a work in progress and is NOT finished.  This will likely not work at all....yet
